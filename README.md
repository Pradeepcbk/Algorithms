# Algorithms
This repository will contain group of c++ algorithms to demonstrate my C++ skills

None of the algorithms are tested in C++ 14 environment and are developed solely by me. 
#### 1. At the top of each of these file, the problem statement which is solved is explained. The bottom of each of these files contain a sample test case with expected outputs.
#### 2. Standard C++ naming conventions are followed in the code
#### 3. Object oriented algorithms are developed using standard template library of C++ 14
